If we have more equations than parameters, then instead of solving $J^{-1} F(\\vec{x})$ (via, e.g., `np.linalg.solve`), you can get a least norm solution via $J^\\dagger F(\\vec{x})$ where $J^\\dagger = (J^\\top J)^{-1} J^\\top$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. In numpy, you can get this solution `np.linalg.lstsq`.  This is equivalent to the \"Gauss Newton\" method we'll talk about later.\n",

But we often have data from more than 4 satellites, and it's a shame to waste that information, so we'll try to use it.  For nice GNSS implementations, you'd actually *weight* each equation by your estimate of the error, since you might have better data from some satellites."

        "## If you're interested, some more facts about GNSS\n",
        "Mostly taken from the [An Introduction to GNSS](https://novatel.com/an-introduction-to-gnss) book, 3rd ed.,  by Hexagon\n",
        "- Some constellations: GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (European Union), BeiDou (China), NavIC (India), QZSS (Japan)\n",
        "  - GPS has 31 satellites, launched in late 70s, available for civilian use starting in 1983. Expanded/improved since then.\n",
        "- Orbit between 11,800 and 22,400 miles above Earth\n",
        "- Transmit on ranges between 1.17 and 1.61 GHz (higher frequency than FM radio, lower than microwave). Very weak by the time they reach you\n",
        "  - L5 band at 1176.45 MHz, L2 band at 1227.60 MHz, L1 band at 1575.42 MHz. These frequencies were chosen because they allow simple antenna design, less ionospheric delays, minimize weather impacts, and to allow high bandwidth codes\n",
        "  - Satellites move about 4 km/sec, and ar large (2,200 kg)\n",
        "  - Use rubidium clocks, accurate to 5 parts in $10^{11}$.\n",
        "  - Syncrhonized with ground-based cesium clocks, even more accurate, which loses a second after 100,000 years\n",
        "  - A quartz watch has an accuracy of 5 parts in $10^6$ and loses a second every two days.\n",
        "  - Light travels about 300 meters in one microsecond, so we need more precision than quartz can provide\n",
        "- Standard GNSS is accurate to a few meters, but there are modern tricks to augment it to get it down to centimeters!\n",
        "- GPS transmits via Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), spread spectrum. Each satellite has a unique pseudorandom digital sequence (PRN code)\n",
        "- The satellite transmits \"ephermeris\" data, which allows you to calculate its position.\n",
        "- There is some information transmitted encrypted for military use which allows higher precision. Somewhat recently, some of this was made public (on purpose) to allow civilian use of more precise information.\n",
        "- Ionosphere (50 to 1000 km above surface) delays are frequency dependent, so using two frequencies (L1 and L2) you can somewhat account for that\n",
        "- Troposphere (lower part of atmosphere, 17 tp 20 km thick) delays signal due to temperature, pressure and humidity.\n",
        "- Multipath (signals bouncing off buildings...) creates errors too\n",
        "- We need 4 satellites, but if they're all nearly overhead, a small error in measurement will lead to a big error in our estimated precision. We want them spread out. We quantify this with \"dilution of precision\" (DOP)\n",
        "- Need to account for Doppler affects; lots of coordinate systems, etc.\n",
        "- Modern systems do **data assimilation**, taking different data sources (e.g., cell phone tower or wifi data) and merging them to get more accurate measurements\n",
        "  - can also assimilate with inertial measurement units (IMU) like a gyroscope/accelerometer on a watch. The IMU is accurate locally and for a short time, which complements the strengths of GNSS\n",
        "- Typical errors\n",
        "  - satellite clocks: 2 meters\n",
        "  - orbit errors: 2.5 meters\n",
        "  - ionospheric delays: 5 meters\n",
        "  - tropospheric dealys: 0.5 meters\n",
        "  - receiver noise: 0.3 meters\n",
        "  - multipath: 1 meter\n",
        "- Improvements\n",
        "  - Get more precise pseudorange using the carrier phase of the signal\n",
        "    - using \"real-time kinematics\" (RTK)\n",
        "  - Differential GNSS uses a fixed base station, with known location, and then it helps you correct for errors\n",
        "    - satellite based augmentation systems do something similar but for a wide area, and then send the information to a satellite, which then broadcasts it to receivers in the area of the base station\n",
        "    - The Wide Area Augmentation System is for aviation, used by the FAA, to do something similar"
